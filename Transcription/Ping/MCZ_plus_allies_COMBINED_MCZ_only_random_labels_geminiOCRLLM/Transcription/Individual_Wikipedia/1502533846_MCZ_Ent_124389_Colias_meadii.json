        "SUMMARY": " Colias is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae. They are often called clouded yellows in the Palearctic and sulphurs (a name also used for other coliadine genera) in North America. The closest living relative is the genus Zerene, which is sometimes included in Colias.\n\nThis genus occurs throughout the Holarctic, including the arctic regions. They are also found in South America, Africa, China and India. Their caterpillars feed on certain Fabaceae, for example vetches (Vicia). The adults forage for nectar. most are thus beneficial by keeping weeds at bay, some occasionally become nuisance pests on crops like alfalfa. In some species, the wings of males have brilliant ultraviolet reflection, while those of females do not. Adults of both sexes have various colour forms. Males are particularly conservative based on their genitalia structures. These structures are difficult to identify making it difficult to classify the Colias.\nMost if not all species of this genus, as usual for Coliadinae, do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants. They are therefore a well-loved prey item of insectivores as compared to Pieris of the related Pierinae. They make up this disadvantage by being more nimble and better able to evade attacks by would-be predators.\nNotable lepidopterologists who did many studies on this genus included Julius R\u00f6ber, J. Malcolm Fawcett, George B. Johnson and Henry Rowland-Brown.\n\n\n\nPage: Colias meadii\n"

        "PAGE_LINK": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater",
        "SUMMARY": " Alma mater (Latin: alma mater; pl.: almae matres) is an allegorical Latin phrase meaning 'nourishing mother'. It personifies a school that a person has attended or graduated from. The term is related to alumnus, literally meaning 'nursling', which describes a school graduate. \nIn its earliest usage, alma mater was an honorific title for various mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele. Later, in Catholicism, it became a title for Mary, mother of Jesus. By the early 17th century, the nursing mother became an allegory for universities. Used by many schools in Europe and North America, it has special association with the University of Bologna, whose motto Alma Mater Studiorum (\"nurturing mother of studies\") emphasizes its role in originating the modern university.\nSeveral university campuses in North America have artistic representations of alma mater, depicted as a robed woman wearing a laurel wreath crown.\n\nPage: Alma Mahler\n"
