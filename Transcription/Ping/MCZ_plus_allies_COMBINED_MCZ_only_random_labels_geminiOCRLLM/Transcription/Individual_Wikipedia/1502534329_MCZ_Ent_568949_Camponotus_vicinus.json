        "SUMMARY": " Chihuahua, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Chihuahua, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, comprise the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is located in the northwestern part of Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the west, Sinaloa to the southwest, Durango to the south, and Coahuila to the east. To the north and northeast, it shares an extensive border with the U.S. adjacent to the U.S. states of New Mexico and Texas. The state was named after its capital city, Chihuahua City; the largest city is Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In 1864 the city of Chihuahua was declared capital of Mexico by Benito Juarez during the Reform War and French intervention. The city of Parral was the largest producer of silver in the world in 1640. During the Mexican War of Independence, Miguel Hidalgo was executed on July 30, 1811, in Chihuahua city.  \nAlthough Chihuahua is primarily identified with its namesake, the Chihuahuan Desert, it has more forests than any other state in Mexico, aside from Durango. Due to its varied climate, the state has a large variety of fauna and flora. The state is mostly characterized by rugged mountainous terrain and wide river valleys. The Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, part of the continental spine that also includes the Rocky Mountains, dominates the state's terrain, and is home to the state's greatest attraction, Las Barrancas del Cobre, or Copper Canyon, a canyon system larger and deeper than the Grand Canyon. The state also has the largest crystal cave in Mexico known as the Naica cave discovered in 2001. Chihuahua is also home to the archaeological site of Paquim\u00e9 in Casas Grandes that was created by the people of the Mogollon civilization of Northern Mexico and is recognized as an UNESCO World Heritage site. Chihuahua is the largest state in Mexico by area, with an area of 247,455 square kilometres (95,543 sq mi), it is slightly larger than the United Kingdom, and slightly smaller than Wyoming, the tenth largest US state by area. The state is consequently known under the nickname El Estado Grande ('The Great State' or 'The Big State').\nThe famous Mexican train Ch-P, a.k.a. \"Chepe\" starts from Chihuahua, calle Mendez, and reaches the Pacific Ocean, through the Sierra Madre and the Copper Canyon.  \nOn the slope of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains (around the regions of Casas Grandes, Cuauht\u00e9moc and Parral), there are vast prairies of short yellow grass, the source of the bulk of the state's agricultural production. Most of the inhabitants live along the Rio Grande Valley, and the Conchos River Valley. The etymology of the name Chihuahua has long been disputed by historians and linguists. The most accepted theory explains that the name was derived from the Nahuatl language meaning \"the place where the water of the rivers meet\" (i.e. \"confluence\", cf. Koblenz).\nChihuahua has a diversified state economy. The three most important economic centers in the state are: Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, an international manufacturing center; Chihuahua, the state capital; and Cuauht\u00e9moc, the state's main agriculture hub and an internationally recognized center for apple production.  Today, Chihuahua serves as an important commercial route prospering from billions of dollars from international trade as a result of NAFTA. The state also suffers the fallout of illicit trade and activities from drug cartels, especially at the border. The state is also home to inventors; Victor Leaton Ochoa, Rafael Mendoza Blanco and Luis T. Hernandez Terrazas. \n\n\n\nPage: Chihuahua City\n"

        "SUMMARY": " Benito Pablo Ju\u00e1rez Garc\u00eda (Spanish: [be\u02c8nito \u02c8pa\u03b2lo \u02c8xwa\u027ees \u0263a\u027e\u02c8si.a] ; 21 March 1806 \u2013 18 July 1872) was a Mexican politician, military commander, and lawyer who served as the 26th president of Mexico from 1858 until his death in office in 1872.  A Zapotec, he was the first Indigenous president of Mexico and the first democratically elected Indigenous president in the postcolonial Americas. A member of the Liberal Party, he previously held a number of offices, including the governorship of Oaxaca and the presidency of the Supreme Court. During his presidency, he led the Liberals to victory in the Reform War and in the Second French intervention in Mexico.\nBorn in Oaxaca to a poor rural Indigenous family and orphaned as a child, Ju\u00e1rez passed into the care of his uncle, eventually moving to Oaxaca City at the age of 12, where he found work as a domestic servant. Sponsored by his employer, who was also a lay Franciscan, Ju\u00e1rez temporarily enrolled in a seminary and studied to become a priest, but he later switched his studies to law at the Institute of Sciences and Arts, where he became active in liberal politics. He began to practice law and was eventually appointed as a judge, after which he married Margarita Maza, a woman from a socially distinguished family in Oaxaca City.\nJu\u00e1rez was eventually elected Governor of Oaxaca and became involved in national politics after the ousting of Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna in the Plan of Ayutla. Ju\u00e1rez was made Minister of Justice under the new Liberal president Juan \u00c1lvarez. He was instrumental in passing the Ju\u00e1rez Law as part of the broader program of constitutional reforms known as La Reforma (The Reform). Later, as the head of the Supreme Court, he succeeded to the presidency upon the resignation of the Liberal president Ignacio Comonfort in the early weeks of the Reform War between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, and led the Liberal Party to victory after three years of warfare.\nAlmost immediately after the Reform War had ended, President Ju\u00e1rez was faced with a French invasion, the Second French Intervention aimed at overthrowing the government of the Mexican Republic and replacing it with a French-aligned monarchy, the Second Mexican Empire. The French soon gained the collaboration of the Conservative Party who aimed at returning themselves to power after their defeat in the Reform War, but Ju\u00e1rez continued to lead the government and armed forces of the Mexican Republic, even as he was forced by the advances of the French to flee to the north of the country. The Second Mexican Empire would finally collapse in 1867 after the departure of the last French troops two months previously and President Ju\u00e1rez returned to Mexico City where he continued as president until his death due to a heart attack in 1872, but with growing opposition from fellow Liberals who believed he was becoming autocratic.\nDuring his presidency, he supported many controversial measures, including his negotiation of the McLane\u2013Ocampo Treaty, which would have granted the United States perpetual extraterritorial rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; a decree extending his presidential term for the duration of French Intervention; his proposal to revise the liberal Constitution of 1857 to strengthen the power of the federal government; and his decision to run for reelection in 1871. His opponent, liberal general, and fellow Oaxacan Porfirio D\u00edaz opposed his re-election and rebelled against Ju\u00e1rez in the Plan de la Noria.\nAfter his death, the city of Oaxaca added \"de Ju\u00e1rez\" to its name in his honor, and numerous other places and institutions have been named after him. He is the only individual whose birthday (21 March) is celebrated as a national public and patriotic holiday in Mexico. Many cities (most notably Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), streets, institutions, and other locations are named after him. He is considered the most popular Mexican president of the 19th century.\n\n\n\nPage"
