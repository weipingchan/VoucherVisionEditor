        "SUMMARY": " Sumatra () is one of the Sunda Islands of western Indonesia. It is the largest island that is fully within Indonesian territory, as well as the sixth-largest island in the world at 482,286.55 km2 (182,812 mi.2), including adjacent islands such as the Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, Enggano, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung and Krakatoa archipelago.\nSumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest\u2013southeast axis. The Indian Ocean borders the northwest, west, and southwest coasts of Sumatra, with the island chain of Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano off the western coast. In the northeast, the narrow Strait of Malacca separates the island from the Malay Peninsula, which is an extension of the Eurasian continent. In the southeast, the narrow Sunda Strait, containing the Krakatoa archipelago, separates Sumatra from Java. The northern tip of Sumatra is near the Andaman Islands, while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of Bangka and Belitung, Karimata Strait and the Java Sea. The Bukit Barisan mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. The equator crosses the island at its centre in West Sumatra and Riau provinces. The climate of the island is tropical, hot, and humid. Lush tropical rain forest once dominated the landscape.\nSumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years. Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore. The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.\n\n\n\nPage: West Sumatra\n"

        "SUMMARY": " Langkat Malay (Langkat Malay: Bahase Melayu Langkat, Jawi: \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0648 \u0644\u06a0\u0643\u062a) is a Malayic language primarily spoken by the Malay people living in Langkat Regency in the northernmost part of North Sumatra, Indonesia. Langkat Malay is closely related to other Malay varieties spoken along the eastern coast of Sumatra, including Deli Malay, Serdang Malay, and Tamiang Malay. Several ethnic groups reside in Langkat, including the Malays, Javanese, Banjarese, Batak, and Minangkabau. While the Malays are the indigenous people of Langkat, Javanese has become more widespread due to migration, as Javanese speakers now form the majority of the population. Despite this, Langkat Malay remains widely spoken in Langkat as the lingua franca and a common language for social interaction among residents. It coexists with other migrant languages such as Javanese, Banjar, and Orang Laut. As a result, some Malays can speak Javanese, Banjar, or Orang Laut, while many Javanese, Banjar, and Orang Laut speakers can also speak Langkat Malay.\nThe Malay people of Langkat use their language in both daily activities and traditional ceremonies. In everyday life, it serves a highly functional role, shaping various aspects of social interaction, including greetings, casual conversations on the street, visiting neighbors, chatting at the mosque before and after prayers, communicating during hunting in the forest, and other communal settings. Compared to its use as a daily communication tool, the use of Langkat Malay in traditional ceremonies exhibits a distinct pattern. This distinct pattern refers to variations that appear different from everyday usage. These variations primarily involve specific word choices or terms that are rarely used in other contexts. Nowadays, under the influence of Indonesian as the national language, many Langkat Malay speakers have begun to code-switch and code-mix between Langkat Malay and Indonesian. The language is currently under threat due to continued migration to Langkat from other parts of Indonesia such as Java, as well as a decline in fluency among Langkat Malays, especially among younger generations, who increasingly prefer to speak Indonesian.\n\n\n\nPage: North Sumatra\n"
