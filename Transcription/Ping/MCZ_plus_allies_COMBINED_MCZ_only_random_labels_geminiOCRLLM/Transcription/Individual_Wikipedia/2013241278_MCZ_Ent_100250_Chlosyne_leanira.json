        "SUMMARY": " Chlosyne leanira, the leanira checkerspot, is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is found in North America from western Oregon south to California, Nevada, Utah and western Colorado, as well as Baja California. The wingspan is 33\u201340 mm. Generally, females are larger than males, but males have a more apparent red color to their wings.\nAdults feed on flower nectar while the larvae feed on Castilleja plants in the Orobanchaceae plant family, particularly the leaves and flowers of this host plant.\nYoung larvae live together in a loose web. Third-instar larvae hibernate, and examination of Chlosyne leanira in Gates Canyon, California revealed that they overwinter as larvae.\n\nPage: Chlosyne\n"
