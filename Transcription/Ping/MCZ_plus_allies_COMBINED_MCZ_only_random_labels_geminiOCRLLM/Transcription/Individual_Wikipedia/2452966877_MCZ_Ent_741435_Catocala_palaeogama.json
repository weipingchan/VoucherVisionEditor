        "SUMMARY": " Catocala palaeogama, the old wife underwing, is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Achille Guen\u00e9e in 1852. It is found in North America from Ontario and Quebec (where it is rare), through Maine, New Jersey, Tennessee, to South Carolina, west to Arkansas and Oklahoma and north through Iowa, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.\nSome authors consider Catocala palaeogama to be a synonym of Catocala neogama.\nThe wingspan is 60\u201370 mm. Adults are on wing from June to October depending on the location. There is probably one generation per year.\nThe larvae feed on Carya alba, C. glabra, C. illinoinensis, C. laciniosa, C. ovalis, C. ovata, Castanea dentata, Juglans nigra and Malus pumila.\n\nPage: List of moths of Canada (Noctuidae)\n"
