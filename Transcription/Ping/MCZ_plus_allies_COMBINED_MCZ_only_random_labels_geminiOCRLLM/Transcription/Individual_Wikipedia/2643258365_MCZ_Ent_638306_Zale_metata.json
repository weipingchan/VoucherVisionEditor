        "SUMMARY": " Shalimar Seiuli, (July 6, 1976 \u2013 April 22, 1998) known professionally as Shalimar or Atisone Seiuli, was an American Samoan transgender dancer and public figure who gained infamy when she was seen getting into the car of the actor Eddie Murphy.\nOn May 2, 1997, Seiuli, a sex worker, was being watched by police before getting into Murphy's SUV. Seiuli was unaware of who the driver was. Murphy was pulled over by police, questioned for thirty minutes, then released, while Seiuli was arrested for an outstanding warrant on prostitution charges. Murphy claimed he was just being a \"good Samaritan\" by giving Seiuli a ride home.\nOvernight, the story made headlines, and was later parodied on an episode of Saturday Night Live. The National Enquirer paid Seiuli's $15,000 bond in exchange for exclusive details on her ride with Murphy.\n\nPage: Shalimar (perfume)\n"
