        "SUMMARY": " Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of symbols, often specifically those of a written language, by means of sight or touch.\nFor educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.\nOther types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems. The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of braille).\n\nPage: Reading, Berkshire\n"
