        "SUMMARY": " Nantucket () is an island in the state of Massachusetts in the United States, about 30 miles (48 km) south of the Cape Cod peninsula. Together with the small islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, it constitutes the Town and County of Nantucket, a combined county/town government.  Nantucket is the southeasternmost town in both Massachusetts and the New England region. The name \"Nantucket\" is adapted from similar Algonquian names for the island.\nNantucket is a tourist destination and summer colony. Due to tourists and seasonal residents, the population of the island increases to around 80,000 during the summer months. The average sale price for a single-family home was $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe National Park Service cites Nantucket, designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1966, as being the \"finest surviving architectural and environmental example of a late 18th- and early 19th-century New England seaport town.\"\n\n\n\nPage: List of United States counties and county equivalents\n"
