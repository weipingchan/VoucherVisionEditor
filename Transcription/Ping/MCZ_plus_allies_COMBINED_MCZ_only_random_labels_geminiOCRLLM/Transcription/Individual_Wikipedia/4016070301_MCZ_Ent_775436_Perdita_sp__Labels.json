        "SUMMARY": " Santa Fe ( SAN-t\u0259 FAY, -\u2060 fay; Spanish: [santa\u02c8fe], lit. \"Holy Faith\") is the capital of the U.S. state of New Mexico, and the county seat of Santa Fe County. With over 89,000 residents, Santa Fe is the fourth-most populous city in the state and the principal city of the Santa Fe metropolitan statistical area, which had 154,823 residents in 2020. Santa Fe is the second-largest city in the Albuquerque\u2013Santa Fe\u2013Los Alamos combined statistical area, which had a population of 1,162,523 in 2020. Situated at the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the city is at the highest altitude of any U.S. state capital, with an elevation of 6,998 feet (2,133 m).  \nFounded in 1610 as the capital of Nuevo M\u00e9xico, a province of New Spain, Santa Fe is the oldest state capital in the United States and the earliest European settlement west of the Mississippi River. Its name, Spanish for \"Holy Faith\", is the  shortened form of its original name, La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds (Royal Town of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis of Assisi).  \nThe province of Nuevo M\u00e9xico became a territory of Mexico after Mexican independence from Spain in 1821. It was ceded to the United States in 1848 following the Mexican\u2013American War, and in 1851 Santa Fe was named the capital of the U.S. Territory of New Mexico. It became New Mexico's state capital in 1912. The city prospered as the region's leading commercial and transportation hub for both Europeans and Native Americans, driven by lucrative trade and migration routes such as El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro and the Santa Fe Trail. Santa Fe maintained its status as the political and cultural center of New Mexico throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and American periods, which have each impacted the city's development and character.  \nBlending indigenous, Spanish, and American influences, Santa Fe is considered the cultural capital of the Southwestern United States, and is widely regarded as one of the country's great art cities due to its vibrant art scene. In 2005, it was the first U.S. city inducted into the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. Santa Fe hosts over 250 art galleries, a large concentration of museums, and three annual art events: the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market; the Traditional Spanish Colonial Market and the Indian Market. One-tenth of all employment is related to artistic and cultural industries, with writers and authors comprising the highest proportion of the labor force of any U.S. city. \nSanta Fe's cultural highlights include Santa Fe Plaza, Santa Fe Historic District, the Palace of the Governors, and Fiesta de Santa Fe; the city is also known for its contributions to New Mexican cuisine and New Mexico music. Among Santa Fe's many artistic institutions are the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, the Chuck Jones Gallery, and the art collective Meow Wolf. The cityscape is known for its adobe-style Pueblo Revival and Territorial Revival architecture, much of which is preserved and protected.\n\nPage: New Mexico\n"
